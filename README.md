Working Steps
Create a Carousel Component:

Use a library like react-native-snap-carousel or implement a basic horizontal scroll view with FlatList.
Define two placeholder items ("Sign of Type A" and "Sign of Type B").
Install Required Dependencies (if using a library):

Install react-native-snap-carousel or any other carousel library.
Integrate the Carousel Component:

Add the carousel to the bottom of the camera view using absolute positioning.
Define Carousel Items:

Create a dataset with the two placeholder 3D object names (e.g., "Sign of Type A" and "Sign of Type B").
Render Carousel Items:

Map each item in the dataset to display as a selectable card or thumbnail in the carousel.
Handle Selection of a Sign:

When a user selects an item in the carousel, highlight the selected sign (e.g., add a border or change background color).
Prepare for 3D Object Display:

For now, show placeholder text or images for the signs in the carousel.
Later, integrate actual 3D objects using an AR library (e.g., expo-three).
Style the Carousel:

Ensure the carousel has proper padding and alignment at the bottom of the screen.
Test it to avoid overlapping with the camera feed.
